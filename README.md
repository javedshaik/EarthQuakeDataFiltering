# EarthQuakeDataFiltering
The main purpose of this was to gain further experience in java.


This project was a coursera assignment on Java Programming where the EarthQuakeParser and Location classes were given by the instructors,
and for the rest of the classes few methods were provided by the instructors as well, and the rest were programmed by me. In addition, the 
instructors provided pdf documents on what to code exactly for each method and what to name each variable in a method.
